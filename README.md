# hello-world
This is my first repository
I am a beginner of SQL and Python and hope to learn enough of each to create an awesome e-portfolio to present to potential employers in the healthcare field. I have a BS in Health Informatics and an RHIA license. I want to make good on these two credentials in a job where I can make a difference in the health of people.
Learning Python has expanded the way I work with my PC now, from all the available datasets I can work with, the code editor I use and the extensions I can add, all the different libraries and the different syntax used to manipulate the datasets, starting a simple script of downloading a csv file to manipulating the data to putting it up on the web for others to see.

If nothing else I have learned quite a bit already but am looking for feedback.

Thanks!
