# hello-world
This is my first repository
I am a beginner of SQL and Python and hope to learn enough of each to create an awesome e-portfolio to present to potential employers in the healthcare field. I have a BS in Health Informatics and an RHIA license. I want to make good on these two credentials in a job where I can make a difference in the health of people.
